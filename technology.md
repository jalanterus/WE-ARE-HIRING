and better, detect bugs early, and create more readable code for others.

We are looking for developers that is comfortable with Typescript and its configuration files and bundling tools. You must already understand
the essential compiler options, usage of typings, and basic webpack.

In addition, we add points on following Angular knowledge and skills:

- lazy load modules and components (v9)
- compose lean components with clean separation of concern
- leverage Angular CDK, material components and services
- RxJS and observable data services
- ngrx
- turn REST and GraphQL APIs into service facades
- use of service worker to improve PWA experience
- angular animations and DOM manipulations

Points for following React knowledge and skills:

- Compose components with clean separation of concern
- Use of and implement higher order components
- Understanding of React hooks and other state management techniques
- TDD development with Jest
- Debugging

- NextJS Framework

## Mobile and Embedded Platform

Recharge develops with Flutter and native (java, kotlin, objective-c, swift).
We build mobile applications and embedded machine terminal applications.

We ship fast, without sacrificing code quality.
We are looking for people who is comfortable coding in both flutter and
using android and ios native platform in a continuous delivery fashion.

Flutter skills that we like:

- thourogh umdertanding of widgets
- platform channel
- Concept of reactive programming with stream and/or rxdart
- Experience with and can explain the differences of state management options
- Understand the reasoning behind BloC pattern
- Embedded local storage of sqflite and shared preferences

Android plus points:

- 2+ years of industry experience building native Android mobile
  applications with Java and Kotlin
- Experience with core Android Jetpack architecture components
  (Room, LiveData, ViewModel, Lifecycles)
- Ability to learn on the fly and share knowledge with teammates
- Experience with Java, Kotlin, and Android system programming
- Undertands Android system
- Good level understanding of Android SDKs
- Have you ever wrote a linux/android device driver? We want you.
- Experience using NDK
- Have written JNI library
- Solid understanding of full mobile development lifecycle
- Knowledge of the Java Android performance tools and optimization techniques.
- Knowledge of Gradle/Groovy scripting
- Knowledge of RxJava
- Designed and work with AIDL

ioS plus points:

- 2+ years of industry experience building native ioS mobile
  applications with Objective-C and Swift
- Use of Xcode and command line tools

To work more on the embedded platform side of the development:

- Clear understanding of Linux like Kernel architecture, design, and
  internals
- Hands on experience in Linux/Android device driver development in C
- Experience with embedded software design, implementation and debugging
  ranging from the driver/Interrupt level up to the application level
- Plus point: thorough understanding of MDB and DEX protocol

## AWS Serverless DevOps
