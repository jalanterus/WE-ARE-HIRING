## User Experience Designer

As an UX Designer it is your goal to make sure our product users have the best experience possible.

You first analyze your audience.

You visualize then you draw illustration, you choose suitable typography and color choices, you shape, retouch, and optimize images, and you make sure they work well with required responsive platforms. You wash and repeat the processes for best result until the time to submit.

You are able to do end-to-end work from low fidelity mock up to high quality interactive design. Maybe even up to the html and css. Awesome.

Your knowledge and experiences have shaped your intuition so that you kind of already know what works and what doesn't. You don't need A/B testing. Yet you do do A/B test your products, and most of the time you are correct.
